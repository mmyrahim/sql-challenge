The EmployeeSQL folder has two SQL files: table_schemata.sql and queries.sql.

table_schemata.sql sets up a database with tables for employee data from CSV files. It uses keys to link these tables.
queries.sql fetches specific employee details from the database.

the folder "data", contains all the data used for the sql queries
